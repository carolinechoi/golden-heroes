            <p id="mission">The Golden Heroes mission is to bring comfort and distraction to kids with cancer in hospitals. Our chemo kits are hospital approved and distributed to a child once they are admitted to an oncology unit, providing an immediate sense of comfort! The kits feature essential items such as blankets, hats, and fluffy socks, as well as fun activities like coloring books, puzzles, games, and art supplies, designed to bring some joy to a temporary or long-term hospital stay.</p>

Eliana volunteered at a pediatric hospital for 3 years as a music therapy volunteer and was a camp counselor at Sunrise Day Camp for kids with cancer and their siblings. She was also a Youth Board Member at the non-profit organization KidsvCancer where she met with Senate representatives to advocate for increased funding of pediatric cancer. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with family, playing piano or guitar, and working on various other passion projects.</p></p>

            <p id="member-bio">Emily Borohov is from Long Island, New York and is the Co-Founder & COO of Golden Heroes. Emily has always had a passion for kids and teaching through her volunteer work at the Morgen Stern School and working at Lawrence Woodmere Academy Summer Day throughout high school.

She loves working with the rest of the Golden Heroes team to put smiles on the faces of children with cancer. In her free time, she enjoys making music, travelling,  and spending time with her little sisters and cute puppy Lucy!
